Enhanced ProtoVM digital logic simulation with convergence algorithm

This major update improves the ProtoVM digital logic simulator to properly handle
the complexities of real digital circuit behavior:

- Implemented multi-tick convergence algorithm that iterates until signals stabilize
- Added proper tri-state bus support with driver arbitration
- Enhanced component change detection to optimize processing
- Added feedback loop resolution within each tick
- Implemented oscillation detection to prevent infinite loops
- Improved state tracking for more accurate simulation

The system now correctly models signal propagation, bus contention, and
component interactions in a way that closely approximates real hardware behavior,
making it suitable for simulating moderately complex digital circuits.
