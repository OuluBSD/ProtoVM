# ProtoVM Digital Logic Simulation - Final Status Report

## Project Summary

We have successfully enhanced the ProtoVM digital logic simulation system to properly handle the complexities of digital circuit behavior. The system now correctly models signal propagation, feedback loops, and component interactions in a way that closely approximates real hardware behavior.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Multi-Tick Convergence Algorithm
- ✅ Implemented convergence-based simulation that iterates until signals stabilize
- ✅ Added proper handling of feedback loops within each tick
- ✅ Implemented oscillation detection to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ Added maximum iteration limits to prevent system lockups

### 2. Enhanced Bus Architecture with Tri-State Support
- ✅ Modified Bus classes to properly handle tri-state logic
- ✅ Added driver tracking to model real bus contention behavior
- ✅ Updated components to properly handle bidirectional bus communication
- ✅ Implemented bus arbitration with tri-state buffer support

### 3. Improved Component Change Detection
- ✅ Added HasChanged/SetChanged methods to all components
- ✅ Implemented state tracking to optimize processing
- ✅ Components now only indicate changes when their internal state actually changes
- ✅ Enhanced Tick() methods to properly report state changes

### 4. Feedback Loop Resolution
- ✅ Added proper handling of combinatorial feedback in digital circuits
- ✅ Implemented oscillation detection to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ Enhanced Machine::Tick() to use convergence algorithm with change detection
- ✅ Improved RunRtOpsWithChangeDetection() to optimize processing

### 5. Component Updates
- ✅ Updated IC6502 to properly track register and flag changes
- ✅ Enhanced ICRamRom to track memory read/write operations and state changes
- ✅ Modified Bus classes to support tri-state behavior and proper driver arbitration

## Benefits Achieved

1. **More Accurate Simulation**: The system now properly models real digital circuit behavior
2. **Better Performance**: Change detection reduces unnecessary processing
3. **Stability**: Oscillation detection prevents simulation lockups
4. **Scalability**: The architecture can handle more complex digital circuits
5. **Debugging Capabilities**: Enhanced logging shows actual component state changes

## Testing Verification

The system has been tested with the 6502-based test setup and successfully:
- ✅ Simulates proper signal propagation between CPU, RAM, and ROM
- ✅ Handles bus arbitration for shared data/address buses
- ✅ Models read/write operations correctly
- ✅ Demonstrates convergence behavior with stable simulation output
