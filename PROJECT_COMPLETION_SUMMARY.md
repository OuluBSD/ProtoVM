## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Convergence-Based Processing
The core enhancement replaced simple sequential processing with a sophisticated convergence algorithm:

```cpp
bool Machine::Tick() {
    int iterations = 0;
    const int MAX_ITERATIONS = 100;
    bool changed;
    
    do {
        changed = false;
        if (!RunRtOpsWithChangeDetection(changed)) {
            return false;
        }
        iterations++;
    } while (changed && iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS);
    
    return true;
}
```

### Intelligent Change Detection
All components now implement state tracking for optimal performance:

```cpp
class ElectricNodeBase {
private:
    bool has_changed = true;
    
public:
    bool HasChanged() const { return has_changed; }
    void SetChanged(bool changed = true) { has_changed = changed; }
};
```

### Tri-State Bus Architecture
Enhanced bus system with proper driver arbitration:

```cpp
template<int Width>
class Bus : public ElectricNodeBase {
    bool is_driven[BYTES];
    byte data[BYTES];
    
public:
    bool PutRaw(uint16 conn_id, byte* data, int data_bytes, int data_bits) override;
};
```
