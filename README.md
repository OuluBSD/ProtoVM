## Welcome, Electronic Enthusiasts!

ProtoVM is more than just a digital logic simulator - it's a playground for electronic hobbyists, a learning tool for students, and a prototyping environment for engineers. Whether you're building your first 8-bit computer or exploring complex digital circuits, ProtoVM provides the virtual workspace to bring your electronic dreams to life.

This project embodies the spirit of innovation that drives the maker community. Just as early computer pioneers like Steve Wozniak handcrafted circuits on breadboards, you can now design, simulate, and test complex digital systems right from your computer.

## Overview

ProtoVM is a custom digital logic simulator that models real hardware components including CPUs, memory, buses, and basic logic gates. Originally developed as a simple sequential processor, it has been significantly enhanced to properly handle the complexities of digital circuit behavior.

The system now correctly models signal propagation, feedback loops, and component interactions in a way that closely approximates real hardware behavior, making it suitable for simulating moderately complex digital circuits.

## Key Features

### 1. Convergence-Based Simulation Engine
Instead of simple sequential processing, ProtoVM now implements a sophisticated multi-tick convergence algorithm that iterates until all signals in the digital circuit stabilize. This approach mimics how real digital circuits behave, where signals propagate through components until reaching a stable state.

### 2. Tri-State Bus Architecture
The enhanced bus system properly models tri-state logic, allowing multiple components to share the same bus lines while preventing electrical conflicts. This includes:
- Driver arbitration mechanisms
- Proper bus contention handling
- Realistic signal floating and pull-up behaviors

### 3. Component State Tracking
All components now implement intelligent change detection, tracking their internal state and only triggering reprocessing when actually needed. This optimization significantly improves simulation performance.

### 4. Feedback Loop Resolution
The system correctly handles combinatorial feedback that can occur in digital circuits, preventing incorrect behavior and ensuring stable simulation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Machine Class
The central coordinator that manages component interactions and executes the convergence-based simulation algorithm. It tracks all PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) and their interconnected components.

#### ElectricNodeBase
Abstract base class for all electronic components in the simulation. Provides common functionality for:
- Connection management
- Signal processing
- State tracking
- Component identification

#### Bus Classes
Specialized components that model address and data buses with proper tri-state support:
- **Bus<T>**: Template class for buses of varying widths
- **AddrBus**: Specialized address bus implementation
- **DataBus**: Specialized data bus implementation

#### Integrated Circuits
Models of actual integrated circuits:
- **IC6502**: Accurate emulation of the MOS Technology 6502 CPU
- **ICRamRom**: Configurable memory components (RAM/ROM)
- **Logic Gates**: Basic digital logic building blocks (NAND, NOR, NOT, etc.)

### Signal Propagation Model

The enhanced ProtoVM models digital signal behavior more accurately:

1. **Tri-State Logic**: Components can drive, read, or float bus lines
2. **Signal Integrity**: Prevention of bus contention through proper arbitration
3. **Propagation Delays**: Implicit modeling through iterative convergence
4. **Setup/Hold Times**: Component behavior respects timing constraints

## Implementation Details

### Convergence Algorithm
The heart of the enhancement is the multi-tick convergence algorithm implemented in `Machine::Tick()`:

```cpp
bool Machine::Tick() {
    int iterations = 0;
    const int MAX_ITERATIONS = 100;
    bool changed;
    
    do {
        changed = false;
        // Process all components until no more changes occur
        if (!RunRtOpsWithChangeDetection(changed)) {
            return false;
        }
        iterations++;
    } while (changed && iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS);
    
    return true;
}
```

This approach ensures that all signal propagation paths are properly resolved within each simulation tick.

### Component Change Detection
Components now implement intelligent state tracking:

```cpp
class ElectricNodeBase {
private:
    bool has_changed = true;  // Track if component state has changed
    
public:
    bool HasChanged() const { return has_changed; }
    void SetChanged(bool changed = true) { has_changed = changed; }
    virtual bool Tick() = 0;
};
```

Only components that have actually changed state trigger reprocessing, optimizing performance.

### Bus Arbitration
The enhanced bus system properly handles multiple drivers:

```cpp
template<int Width>
class Bus : public ElectricNodeBase {
    bool is_driven[BYTES];  // Track which bytes are actively driven
    byte data[BYTES];        // Bus data
public:
    bool PutRaw(uint16 conn_id, byte* data, int data_bytes, int data_bits) override;
};
```

This prevents bus contention and models realistic tri-state behavior.

## Usage
