INTRODUCTION

This paper describes the architecture of the CPU and Memory
for the Central Air Data Computer (CADC) System used in the Grumman/
Navy FI4A carrier-based fighter aircraft. The CADC performs
specialized computerational functions in response to input stimuli
such as pressure sensors, temperature sensors and closed loop
feedback inputs, Outputs from the CADC system are used to drive
pilot visual displays (such as, altimeter, temperature indicator,
mach number indicator, etc.) and to provide control inputs for
other aircraft systems. The outputs from the CADC are in the form
of digital and analog signals. Figure i illustrates a block
diagram for the CADC.

Being in a flight environment meant that certain constraints
must greatly reflect the architecture of the CPU and Memory.
These constraints were size, power, reai-time computing capability
and cost, not necessarily in that order. Other constraints such
as temperature, acceleration and mechanical shock affected the
overall design of the CADC.

The size of the CPU-Memory was limited to a maximum of 40
square inches. This included the arithmetic section, read-only
memory, and read/write memory. Since the unit was to be packaged
on a printed circuit card the number of Layers of the p.c. card
was an important consideration. The power consumption had a limit
of 10 watts at ambient 25°C. This was principally a function of
the capabilities of the p.c. card to withstand the heat.

The required computing capacity for the CPU was not defined
at the beginning. This meant that the system had to be somewhat
flexible to changes in computational load. Of course limits had
to be set to be able to work within the other constraints. What
was known about the computation was the form of the equations to
be implemented, This included polynominal evaluations, data limit-
