Since each SL has three outputs the capability is there to
perform three additions and/or subtractions during one word
time. Output 3 has the added feature of performing two additions
during the same data transfer. This would be A+58+C. This
feature was incorporated te handle the many cases of concluding
a polynomial evaluation and adding another value to it, This
would look like (A, x+AQ)} + ¥. As the product of A,x is being
transferred to memory the Ag constant and Y value can be added
to it. As can be seen the addition and subtraction, if used
properly, can take "zero" time since transferring of data has
to be accomplished anyway.

These four units comprise the hardware that can perform
arithmetic operations, As shown in Figure 2 each PMU, PDU and
SLF has a Data $teering Unit associated with them. As will be
discussed later this allows many data paths to be operating
consecutively, Thus computational power is greatly increased.

MEMORY UNITS

There are two memory units, Read-Only Memory (ROM) fer
instruction storage and Random Access (Read/Write) Storage (RAS)
for intermediate data storage, The ROM cperates as a 2560-bit
yvandom access/sequential access device, It internally stores
fixed patterns of 128 words of 20 bit length for serial readout.
The patterns are specified by the user. The ROM has provision
to accept a 20-bit serial binary word address. The first seven
bits indicates which of the 128 words is to be accessed, and
the next three bits specifies, by manufacture mask decoding,
which ROM out of a possible eight ROM group should have its
output enabled.

The address management is accomplished by 2a register counter
contained within the ROM. This counter has the following cap-
ability: (1) resettable, (2) steppable such that the memory can
be sequenced through the 128-word field, (3) accepts a retain
address command and holds the present address, and (4) accepts
a numerical input for independent address modifying or loading.
