To accomplish the above address management, six logic inputs
{reset (R), retain, increment, load, add, sub} and one address
data input are provided,

The address field is defined as follows: the first seven
LgB's will select one of 128 20-bit words, The next three will
be used to select one of eight ROM's, the remaining ten will be
zero. The three~bit select field will determine, by mask decod-
ing, which chip's (ROM) output is to be enabled. ROM's that
are not enabled by the chip select field have disabled their
outputs. The particular application described in this paper
uses the ROM in the sequential access mode only.

The RAS memory operates as a 16-word random access read-
write storage device. Information is shifted serially into
and out of selected registers during W,. Memory readout is
nondestructive, i.e., if a register is selected to be read only,
then the data are also rewritten into the selected register.

The RAS accepts an instruction word of 5 bits during W,- The
least significant four bits of the instruction word specifies
one of sixteen 20-bit serial registers. The contents of the
selected register is shifted out to the data output serially
during the next Wp and Way At the Wo time, information from

the data input is written into the selected register if the
fifth control bit is a "1", If the fifth bit is a "Q"">, the
register contents remain unaffected, An external logic input
“inhibit write’ is provided to inhibit writing. The instruction
word selects registers according to the following configuration:
