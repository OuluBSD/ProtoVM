SYSTEM OPERATION AND INSTRUCTION FORMAT

This processor uses a total of 28 circults., The breakdown
is as follows:
-~ Parallel Multiplier Unit (PMU)
-- Parallel Divider Unit (PDU)
== Special Logic Function (SLF)
-- Random Access Storage Units (RAS)
-- Data Steering Units (SL)
19 -- Read-Only Memory Units (ROM)
An actual photograph of the processor is shown in Figure 6,

The system has been divided into three modules, each module identi-
fied by its arithmetic unit. The modules are as follows:

Multiply Divide Special Logic
Module 1 Module 2 Module 3
L -- PMU 1 -- PDU 1 -- SELF
Lo-- SL 1 -- SL 1 -- SL
1 == RAS 1 -- RAS 1 -- RAS
3 «- Data ROM's 1 -- Data ROM 2? -- Data ROM's
3 -- Instruction Instruction Instruction
ROM's ROM's ROM's

Each arithmetic unit has an associated steering unit and RAS
unit. This is not an absolutely necessary association but is chosen
to add flexibility to the programming. Figure 7 illustrates another
possibility of a circuit arrangement. It is important to note thaEe
the hardware arrangement is flexible to the given problem statement.
If many muitiplies are needed in a given problem then two or more
multiplier units could be used instead cf one. The same can be true
for any of the other circuits.

Each module as shown in Figure 2? is a specialized CPU with its
own data and instruction storage and read/write storage. Each
operates as told by its instruction word. All of the modules are
operating consecutively, each doing what it was dedicated for, The
interconnection of tthe modules determines how the units work together
The timing pulses to the units provide synchronization between Chen,
