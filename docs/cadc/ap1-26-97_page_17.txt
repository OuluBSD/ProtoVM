For a unit to accept data from a source the output of the source
must be connected to the input of the steering unit for that module.
The transfer of data from module to module is a function of the
interconnect and the instruction word. Every Wy time a new instruc-
tion word is transferred from each instruction ROM group to the
units in each module. These instruction words define the data
path to be selected to each output of each steering unit during the
next Wy cycle. System operation continues in this manner, W,
(instruction fetch), Wy (data fetch) until the system executive
control resets the instruction ROM's. Data storage ROM's can be
treated like the outputs from the other circuits. They are
connected to the inputs of the steering units. The total number
of ROM's used in each group is a function of the total amount of
storage required and the update rate of the system. The number
of arithmetic units is a function of the amount of calculation and
the update rate of the system. As shown, the hardware is flexible
to handle changes in two directions: computational load and
update rate. This flexibility is required to handle the various
types of systems to be implemented,

A general hardware arrangement illustrating the flexibility
of the hardware is shown in Figure 8. The final configuration
chosen by the user must depend on the total system programming
requirements.

For the system in Figure 2 the following would be its three

instruction word formats.
