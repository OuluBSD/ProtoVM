ing, data comparison and discrete or flag inputs and outputs.
This meant that the arithmetic and logical functions of the

system had to handle at least the following aperations:

Multiply

Divide

Add

Subtracck

Limits

Square Root

And

Or

Conditional Transfer
Unconditional Transfer
Recelve Discrete Data
Receive Digital Data
Qutput Discrete Data
Output Digital Data

The last constraint of cost was certainly important since
the system would eventually go into high volume production.

FUNCTIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED

Before we proceed, a better understanding of the functions
to be implemented is necessary. The function that most often

occurred was the polynomial,
_ 6 5 4 3 2 1
F(X) = Ags + agx” + a,x + agx + aoe” + a,x + ag
where x was the input, either from outside the CPU (sensors) or
from its own memory.

In order to save arithmetic time the polynomial was implemented
in its “nested” form as follows:

F(X) = (CCC C(xa,) + az) x + a,) x + 2q) x + ay) x + a) x,+ ag

The data limit function was one that would accept 3 binary
inputs, an upper limit (U), a lower Limit (L) and a parameter (P>.
The output would then be as follows;

PifU2s: P2tL.
Lif P « L
UiiPe;> L
