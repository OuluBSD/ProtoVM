SYSTEM EXECUTIVE CONTROL

The system executive control is used to control many parts of

the total system.

In

general, it is used to control the inputs

(A/D, diseretes, sensor inputs},the outputs (D/A, digital data,

discrete), and the processor modules,

The system executive control consists of an associated group

of ROM's, supplying a 20-bicE control word every operation time.

Each bit has a preassigned task based upon the hardware configura-

tion. The assignment for each of the bits might be as follows:
