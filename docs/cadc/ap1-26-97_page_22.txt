System executive control bits 13 through 19 are assigned
to control the processor modules. The reason for having such a
control is to minimize the storage requirements in the ROM's by
disabling their operation when they are not being used.

SOFTWARE COMMENTS

The software for this system is closely associated with the
hardware arrangement. To program such a system efficiently
requires complete knowledge of the hardware, At the present
time there is no assembler available to properly handie Ehe
multiple instruction set and data path considerations to yield
an efficient program.

Present programming requires hand coding at the machine
code level, This is certainly tedious but it results in a more
efficient circuit interconnect and minimum total instruction
words, All of this reflects the number of arithmetic modules
and ROM's necessary to handie a particular problem.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

The advantages cf such a system are determined by the
constraints under which system design was accomplished. The
size of the circuit packages were such that the original size
constraint was met. The sizes are indicated below:

Multiplier Unit - 28 pin dual in-line package
Divider Unit = 28 "
Special Logic Unit - 28 "
Steering Unit - 28 "
R.O.M. - 14 "
R.A.5S,. -~ 14 "

The flexibility of the hardware to adapt to a great number
of problem statements along with its R.O.M. reprogramming capa-
bility is certainly a feature desirable in all systems of this
kind. The Fact that the software and hardware can be used in
conjunction with each other helps to reduce the total parts count
in the system. When total parts are reduced then power consumption

and cost will be reduced. Power consumption for the CPU-Memory
