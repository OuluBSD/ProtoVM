discussed in this paper exceeded the original 10 watts. This
was due to the large quantity of read-only memory needed to
implement the problem statement, With present day technology
the cost of such a commercial CPU-Memory system could be less
than $2000 in large quantities. This is based on a price of
tess than $65 per circuit type.

The disadvantages of this system is reflected in the software,
To hand code the entire program in a machine such as this is a
time consuming and tedious effort. To use an assembler or trans-
lator to perform the coding would result in a less efficient
program and possibly more hardware. To obtain the minimal
hardware configuration a person with both hardware and software
knowledge of the system is needed, Future designs of this nature
need to be worked closer with the software requirements in order

to minimize the effort required for programming.

SUMMARY

A CPU-Memory system has been presented that satisfied the
requirements of a particular application. The "pipelined"
approach resulted in a system with enough flexibility to satisfy
the present requirement and to adapt to other areas of applica-
tion. MOS technology previded "state of the art" power dis-
sipations and packaging densities obtainable in no other way.
This system proved to be the most effective in meeting the

given requirements.
