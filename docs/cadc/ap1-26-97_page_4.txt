Even though such a function could be programmed in software, it
was decided to build it in hardware since it was used often

enough.

Data conditioning and scaling also had to be accomplished.
This involved the following simple expressions:

+
F=S4

Again the occurance of these were frequent enough to warrent
hardware consideration. This will become apparent later when the
hardware is discussed,

Since size and power consumption was of the ultimate importance,
MOS technology was chosen as the means of circuit implementation.
This allowed greater packaging densities to be obtained that
otherwise would not be. The slowness of MOS devices and the high
thresholds used allowed a design that was virtually immune to
electrical noise on the ground or transmitted from packages within
elose proximity, The higher supply voltages required resulted in
a more efficient power supply design.

NUMBER SYSTEM

The CPU is a fractional fixed point machine with the most
significant bit a sign bit and the other bits representing data.
Negative numbers are represented in two's complement notation.
Two's complementation was chosen Co avoid the ambiguity of double

zeros.

The word length chosen for the system was 20 bits; 19 bits
of data and 1 bit for sign. This length was chosen after a thorough
analysis of the accuracy required for certain throughput calculations
such as the rate of change of altitude function.
