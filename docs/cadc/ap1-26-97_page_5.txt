Early in the architecture study it was realized that
package size and quantity should be kept to a minimum if we were
to meet the size constraints established, With minimum packaging
space requirements it was necessary to use packages with the
fewest possible leads. This would minimize the complex p.c, card
4nterconnect which was inevitable. Because of this the processor
was designed to transfer data serially throughout the entire system,

PROCESSOR PARALELLISM

As is known by all computer designers, serial machines are
usually not the best way to go if computational speed is needed.
To get around this it was decided to have several arithmetic or
processing units working at the same time. This resulted in a
technique known as "pipeline processing" or "pipeline concurrency".
As defined by Bell and Newell” “pipeline concurrency is the name
given to a system of multiple functional units, each of which is
responsible for partial interpretational and execution of the

instruction stream."

This system uses multiple functional units each dedicated

for a specific task, These functional units are:

, Parallel Multiplier Unit (PMU)

. Parallel Divider Unit (PDU)

. Special Logic Function (SLF)

. Data Steering Unit (SL)

. Random Access Storage (Read/Write) (RAS)
. Read-Only Memory Unit (ROM)

Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the functional units as
they would work together in a typical system. Each unit was designed
to operate as a separate entity and could be used without the need
of any of the other units. This was done to provide maximum
expandibility with minimum additional hardware, Each functional
unit is controlled by its own micro-instruction ROM. The micro-
instructions are also transferred serially to minimize package
pin count, Temporary data storage is provided in the form of
read/write memory.
