by means of a parallel algorithm in one more word time (Wy). The
quotient is shifted out in the next Wp, while inputs for the next
operation are simultaneously shifted in. The division operation
is achieved by using a non-restoring division algorithm.” An
actual photograph of the PDU chip is shown in Figure 4,

The Special Logic Function performs logical operations and
generates specific data and logic outputs, The unit accepts an
instruction word which specifies details of the operation.

The fundamental logical operation of this unit is the limit
funetion, It consists of three registers (U,P, and L} whose inputs
arrive in Wy. One of these registers is picked at the end of W,
by associated comparison logic. Other logic functions such as
AND's, OR's, GRAY CODE (special), Conditional, and Unconditional
data branching is also included in this Logic.

The Data Steering Unit operates as a three channel serial
digital data multiplexer. Information is shifted serially through
the device during Wy- A 15 bit instruction word is accepted
during W, that specifies which input or input combinations (Add
or subtract) is to be "steered" to each of three data outputs,

The instruction word for this unit is the last 15 bits of the
90-bit instruction word. From the least significant end, the
first four bits specifies the selection for Output 1. The next

four bits specifies the selection for Output 2 and the last
seven bits specifies the selection for Output 3. Addition or
subtraction is performed by specifying that output combination
to be "steered" to the output. By performing additions and
subtractions in this manner the programmer can obtain the sum
and difference during the same word time that the data is being
transferred. This transfer may be either to or from the memory
or arithmetic units, Specific instruction codes are interpreted

as follows:
