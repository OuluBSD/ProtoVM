# HLA3 Assembler for Intel 4004

This directory is reserved for the High-Level Assembler 3 (HLA3) "Assembler Developer's Kit" for creating the 4004 assembler.

## Setup Instructions

To properly set up HLA3 for 4004 assembly:

1. Download the HLA3 Assembler Developer's Kit from the appropriate source
2. Extract the contents to this directory
3. Follow the included documentation to set up the 4004-specific assembler

## Requirements

- The 4004 has 45 instructions that need to be defined
- Syntax definitions for all 4004 opcodes
- Code generation capabilities for 4004 machine code

## Files Expected

- `hla3.exe` or `hla3` (assembler binary)
- 4004 instruction definitions
- Syntax definition files
- Example programs and documentation

## Integration

Once HLA3 is installed in this directory, the 4004 assembler can be developed to:
- Define all 45 4004 instructions
- Generate proper machine code for the 4004 CPU
- Create example programs to demonstrate functionality
